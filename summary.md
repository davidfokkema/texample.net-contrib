Fluor energy levels
===================

In particle physics, the most important experimental problem is that of
detecting particles.  A cheap and highly efficient solution is using
*scintillators*.  These kinds of detectors emit light when a charged
particle traverses the detector.  The light-emitting process is depicted
in this figure.  The layout was inspired by [this wikipedia
graphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pistates.svg).  The TikZ code
in my version is a bit complex, mainly due to manual layout tweaks,
shifting some positions here and there.  The figure shown here is a minor
revision of the one included in [my PhD
thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.3990/1.9789036534383).
